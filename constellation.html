  <!---------The theme here is fantasy sci fi and inspired by the time of year mixing nature with alien sci fi and horror, also playing on the idea of a brutally violent and bloodthirsty vegetarian that drinks ignorant blood.. I realized I didnt have alot of time to think of ideas so the content is a little random and I just focused on making the style which is essentially playing on black and red, dark and bloody, or black forest cake, or chunks of unskinned meat, or scalp pieces, or blood drenched concrete..... I used google fonts for this nice drippy looking font---->
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="Planet.css">
    <Title>Pyramid</Title>
    <!-----space stuff makes me think about pyramids, I made a little favicon when i thought I had time for that--->
      <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="stardog.ico">
    <!------it confused me how the style tag started and ended------->

<!----- this is kind of like a profile page that you see on a consultants website except it has strange horror characters... then at the end Im just going to jumble pictures from my what I consider to probably be my favourite text book from university, despite hating it when i forcefully had to read 1000 pages in a few months to pass, not realizing back then what it had actually said--->
