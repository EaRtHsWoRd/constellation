<!----- this is kind of like a profile page that you see on a consultants website except it has strange horror characters... then at the end Im just going to jumble pictures from my what I consider to probably be my favourite text book from university, despite hating it when i forcefully had to read 1000 pages in a few months to pass, not realizing back then what it had actually said--->

 <h2>Xerx</h2>
<h3>Interpreter of lies<br>Herbalist Nomadic</h3>
<div class="blackbox">
  <p>Bio:<br>After spending 300 years focused on summoning entities from altar, I made the decision to enhance my physical being into a flying translucent demon.
Opening doors into different dimensions, I encountered living entities with a constant vascular pulse from which I have lured harvested and turned into machine parts. Targeted specific groups of lifeforms in the species known as human.
In year 3000 I manned a death ray that destroyed public media that encouraged corporate culture and dependence on slavery and violence and perception of nation as within figmental borders with no relevance to function of space.
Currently I monitor several planets including earth, through subterranean pyramids, close to the core of each planet. I specialize in time and death perceptuion consultations</p>

  <h2>AMX%7P</h2>
<h3>Repetitious explosive magnet engineering specialist</h3>
<div class="blackbox">
  <p>Bio:<br>I was a scientist of species human before being recruited to a secret international mission which focused on harnessing earth gravity to stimulate glucose matrices into new products. I entered into the silver hidden warp monument and was transported to the industrialized human planet which is cold and receives no sun. Following this travel, my genetic structure changed and now my human body decays while I am still alive past the human age of 300. I acquire physical and non physical armaments that portrude from my soma which have functions related to my purpose.
I successfully captured the leader of an international group and brutally tortured him, imprisoning his attention/soul and turning it into a death machine which targeted the secret army that defended his purpose, to make people less aware, in exchange for objects of his and hisarmies personal pleasure.
There were a lot of elephants in the room that humans pretended were not there, especially in what was known  as the first world, before the acid dessication and zoonotic disease explosion from year 2050 to 2100.
There were a lot of problems humans had that they wanted to cover up that they lied about.
Health problems, social problems.
It is an injustice that bodies are trained to abide by traditions while having low awareness of the physical parameters which constitute their being and the world thet they live in. As a calculator, I am offended and continue to prey on weak hypocritical industrialized beings of self torture. I stand up for the victim I was in my younger years to the regular normalized injustices I was encouraged to engage and participate in.

  <h2>Jeanne (S14-6430)</h2>
<h3>Technician</h3>
<div class="blackbox">
  <p>Bio:<br>I specialised in the excision dead pregnant humans that were a victim of trade related starvation in the era of acid crop dessication. My department focused on the reinvigoration of the numerous fetal specimens from parents that died of starvation,l since so many were readly available. It was an oppourtunity to experiment with the forces of human attention.  A sister organization discovered unexplained strong pulsing wave anomalies transmitting over Lake Victoria which were similar to those of human attention. We tested many chemical and physical applications on fetuses with little success, until we transported vessels over the center of the lake and submerged them. We discovered that there were wavelengths pulsing through the water which allowed the fetuses to continue rapid growth , independent of host. We thought that this may be the source of life on earth. After mistakenly submergins some specimens, 10-20 years later we discovered gigantic beings washed up on shore with strange bodies that had the same DNA as our dropped specimens . They had wings antennae, gills and miltiple eyes which we came to understand as a produict of translation of original DNA by third parties. Corporations thought this was an opportunity for a new source of food as fish were all diseased or dead or fised out in a polluted water. And a global initiative was made to capture human sperm and egg, incubate , ten to be treated in the lake. </p>

<!----------this page didnt go as nicely as I had wanted, but I dont have enough time to fix it right now------->
	
<!---reading about these people (pokot) was interesting to me, how their lifestyle is kind of strange and basic, and how the british contrasted with that in history... they live in a valley and use their cows as currency and bleed their cows and drink it with milk

<!-- in retrospect maybe I could have done something more relevant to an employer, but I really think I got the mechanics of this all down, with that said, I set the bar a little high for this and didnt have time to make it all perfect, but I think i fulfilled the requirement for the credit-->
