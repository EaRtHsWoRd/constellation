  <!---------The theme here is fantasy sci fi and inspired by the time of year mixing nature with alien sci fi and horror, also playing on the idea of a brutally violent and bloodthirsty vegetarian that drinks ignorant blood.. I realized I didnt have alot of time to think of ideas so the content is a little random and I just focused on making the style which is essentially playing on black and red, dark and bloody, or black forest cake, or chunks of unskinned meat, or scalp pieces, or blood drenched concrete..... ---->
