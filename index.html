  <!--------earth sword or earths word, I used this name in another project and thought it was cool.. I made it with the funky case before you said that we shouldnt do that --The theme here is fantasy sci fi and inspired by the time of year (haloween)mixing nature(the background) with alien sci fi and horror, also playing on the idea of a brutally violent and bloodthirsty vegetarian that drinks ignorant blood(inspired by me when people say the stupidest sh!t in response to me very consciously choosing not to to eat meat after 30 years of eating every day).. I realized I didnt have alot of time to think of ideas so the content is a little random and I just focused on making the style which is essentially playing on black and red, dark and bloody, or black forest cake, or chunks of unskinned meat, or scalp pieces, or blood drenched concrete =}..... I used google fonts for this nice drippy looking font---->

    <!-----space stuff makes me think about pyramids, I made a little favicon when i thought I had time for that--->

<!---This was just supposed to be a test for my header stylings but I ended up trying to use it because it made it look kind of like a movie poster------>
<h1>I am watching you from the far stars when you are alone</h1>
  <h2> I am waiting for you here</h2>
  <h3> you are not the only one</h3>
  <h4>XXXXXXXXX</h4>
<!--- this line is in a small font because it kind of forces you to look closely at it and its alittle creepy--->
  <h5>Who said he wanted to see the devil inside of himself, and just needed to look in the mirror...</h5>

<!------ I was just playing with text and the divs I discovered bere, but its inspired by what I think... in an exaggerated and dark way---->
<div class="whitebox">

<div class="whitebox">
  <h2>INSTITUTIONALIZED?</h2>
  <p>AND PERPETUATING THE DEPENDENCE OF THE NEXT GENERATION ON SLAVERY AND VIOLENCE?</p>
</div>
<!---- because people mostly dont have a direct association with the food they eat, when it is like 100% of their body, and we are encvouraged by people who make money from food, including our government, to precieve it in a way that also exploits our increasing dependence on it, whether or not we agree with the things involved in the production and disposal of our food-->
<div> BORN IN A NATION THAT CALLS ITSELF YOURS BEFORE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS? AND THEN CLAIMS THAT IT HAS BORDERS OUT SIDE OF YOU WHICH YOU BELONG TO, AND ARE INVISIBLE, EXCEPT BY WEAPONS THAT YOU DISAGREE WITH?
<!---because nations have fake borders, and most people dont think to kill eachother , before they are prompted with ideas that they didnt fathom first handedly-->
<h1>THIS IS A PRODUCT OF INDUSTRIALIZED LEARNING TO ENCOURAGE A CULTURAL DEPENDENCE ON TRADE ITEMS</h1>
  <!--- referring to the school system, i wont digress in reference this line-->
<p>THAT HAS A COMMON IDEOLOGICAL FUNDAMENT, WHICH CAN BE TRACED IN ACTUAL DOCUMENTED HISTORY</p>
<!--it makes me angry that we can be in school for 10 years of our early life and learn nothing, so that most of our parents can struggle trying to succeed in something that actually makes most people miserable without understaning why--->
<h1>SYNONOMOUS WITH MASS PRODUCING LIVING BEINGS, FORCIBLY AND SUBJECTING THEM TO A FACILITY DESIGNED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF INANIMATE OBJECTS </h1>
  
  <p>WHAT IS IT THAT WE HAVE BECOME TIRED ABOUT
  AND ARE WE REALLY SETTLING FOR LESS?
  EMBRACING SLAVERY AND POOR HEALTH DECISIONS
  RELATED TO OUR DISSASSOCIATION WITH OUR CONSTITUENT PARTS...
  -THE EARTH.
  </p>
  
  <h2>WHERE DID WE REALLY COME FROM?</h2>
 
  <!--------this part is supposed to be like a business card, and I just came up with random stuff as services.. didnt have time to finalize the idea... Id originally thought of this in my head as kind of a joke but it looks cool under the scary stuff---->

 <!---admittedly the only thing original about this picture is that i photoshopped the kids face.
